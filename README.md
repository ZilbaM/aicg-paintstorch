I fixed the code so it would run properly (dimension problems in the intraining generation, the initial dataset was sliced to the first 4 elements), but my computer doesn't allow me to run the code entirely. I managed to launch a generation after 200 iterations (see generation.png) but the result is disappointing and the code crashes before reaching another milestone due to the code using too much ressources. I can't manage to get a proper model file out of this, so I cannot make a web interface using the model.

If i'm provided with a working model, I can make a proper web app for bonus points if that would be ok with you.
